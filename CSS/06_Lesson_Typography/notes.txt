|| Typography is the way that text is arranged and presented.

1. Font settings
Font settings are not inherited in all elements.
For example, form label inherits the parent's settings, but form Placeholder and Button text do not inherit those settings by default.
It can be fixed with
```
input, button {
	font: inherit;
}
```

2. text-... settings:

Text indentation is good example of using the 'em' elements as it depends on the parent's text size.
text-indent: 2em;

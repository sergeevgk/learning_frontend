Position

1. Default position of all elements is 'static'.

2. 'absolute' positioning needs a relative element. 
	If it doesn't have an ancestor element that is positioned relative, then it takes the original (initial) boundry. 
	The closest ancestor is chosen if more than one are relative.

3. 'relative' works in both directions - from child to parent and otherwise.
	If one element is relative, it is not necessary to define 'position: relative' on the other element. 

4. 'fixed' position is really fixed: it does not change on scrolling!
	The element stays at the same place on screen for all the time.

	! position: fixed; is pulling the element out of normal flow.
	The element is no more the block-level element, and becomes inline one.


5. 'sticky' sticks to the parent container on the position set in its settings. 
	It moves until it reaches the end of container (and goes away with content).

6. z-index (order in which the elements appear on the screen)
	Initially it relates on the order of elements in the HTML file - the last is the topmost.
	Default value is 0.

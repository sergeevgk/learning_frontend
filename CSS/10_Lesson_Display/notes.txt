This is about 'display' setting of element. Possible values are: block, inline, inline-block (but not limited to).

1. Block-level elements and inline-level elements

Block-level elements take 100% of available for them width.
Block-level elements stack on top of each other because of this and always create a new line (line-break).

Inline-level elements (blocks) use only content width (including padding) for them.
They do not depend on 'top' and 'bottom' margin (it doesn't change anything) and 'height'.
The padding can be applied but it does not respects other elements and simply overlap them.

2. inline-block:

Compared to inline:
- inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element;
- also, top and bottom margins are respected;
- padding respects top and bottom of block (block increases its size).

Compared to block:
- Does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

This can be used to create a horizontal list instead of vertical.

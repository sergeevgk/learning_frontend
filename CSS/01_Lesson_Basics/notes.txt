1. Stylesheets are applied in cascading order in the order they are loaded in HTML.
2. If possible it is better to avoid in-line (style as tag's attribute) stylesheets.
	External stylesheets are preferred as they keep the css code separated from other things.
3. If something declared wrong - it is just ignored (i.e. 'colour' instead of 'color'). 
	If one wants to validate the css style file, one can use some external sites / extensions.

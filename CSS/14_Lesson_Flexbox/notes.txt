Flex container:

This applies to elements where 'display: flex' is applied.
These elements are considered 'flex' elements and their behaviour changes.

1. Horizontal and vertical layout settings

- Horizontal alignment
	'justify-content': 
	flex-start: default (left alignment when in row), 
	flex-end: right alignment when in row,
	center: center alignment,
	space-around: same space between items, some space around,
	space-between: same space between items, no space around,
	space-evenly: same space between and around (at the beginning and in the end) items.

- Vertical alignment
'align-items': flex-start, flex-end, center.
	There are no space-... options because there is only 1 item at a time in each 'column'.
	This applies only to the whole row, and aigns it to the start, end or center.



2. Direction of sequence
'flex-direction': row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
	Changes the direction [and order if -reverse] of items. Like transponse of matrix.

3. Wrap
By default, flexbox row is a row of boxes. 
It does not wrap when changing size of window - it simply overgrows the container and don't stay inside the page.

'flex-wrap': wrap makes them wrapping on the overflow of container.


4. Flex-low =  flex-direction + flex-wrap
'flex-flow: row wrap;' as an example.

5. Aligning of content (like rows on wrapping):
	'align-content': flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.


Flex items (elements inside flex-container):

1. Flex changing of size

'flex-basis' - the base size for other flex items setting

'flex-grow', 'flex-shrink': koefficient with default = 1. 
	Determines with which rate the item should increase / decrease its size among other flex items.

Shorthand for all of those:
'flex': grow shrink basis
	ex. 'flex': 1 2 100px

2. Order
Changes the order (more like priority) of particular element in the sequence.
Default: 0, values from -99 to 99.
Applies after 'flex-direction' of the flex container.

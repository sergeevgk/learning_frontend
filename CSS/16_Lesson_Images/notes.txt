Images


1. Width and height attributes of HTML element <image>
They are not used as actual width and height, you would rather want to set actual ones in CSS file.
They are fallback ones and tell browser to reserve this space in any case, i.e. when CSS files failes to load.

2. Images are not block-level elements - they are inline-level elements.
We often do not want this behavior - it makes an element to have space around it and behave not as expected.


3. Images can be combined (notice transparenty).
'background' setting can contain each of combined images' settings, but in the order (1st image settings, 2nd image settings)
like this:
  background: repeat-y right center url('../img/bubbles.png'), no-repeat center linear-gradient(to left,steelblue, rgb(190, 118, 190), white);
  background-size: 25%, auto;

  It can contain background-size also, but sometimes it is put  after common settings.

4. Some browsers do not support some functions as-is.
There is a site to check compatibility: caniuse.com
For some settings -webkit- is needed.
i.e. -webkit-background-clip: text;

1. Absolute length units.

	Px (pixels) is the standard as stated by the MDN.

	NB: when user changes 'appearance / font' settings in his browser, this does not affect the settings in absolute units.
	! It is not a good choice to always display text in absolute units without any relation to the browser settings !
	For text other options are better.

	Absolute values are good for borders, etc.


2. Numbers, lengths and percentages

	- percentages:
	represents a fraction of some other value. Always related to some quantity.

	The percent represents a fraction of the same value of parent's element.

	Commonly used to set the sizes of elements in relation to the page size (width, height).

3.Relative length units

- rem: 
	Font size of the **root** element. 
	If it is not set up explicitly (in html tag font settings), then it is set by default by browser.
	In this case the font-size is not dependent of its parent element.

- em:
	This is related to the parent element which could also look to its parent, etc.
	This may cause amplification of size when introduced font-size somewhere in the parent between the element and the root.

	When em is used inside the element where font-size is present, like:

	h1 {
	border: 2px dashed red;
	width: 50%;
	font-size: 3rem;
	padding: 0.5em;
	}

	then the padding's em is dependent on font-size also, so the padding becomes larger.
	Also could be used for a button's margin / padding.


- ch:
	Character's size. It is the measurement of '0' element in the font.


- vw:
	viewport width = 1% of the viewport's width.
	Most of the time percentage gives the same result.

- vh:
	viewport height = 1% of the viewport's height.

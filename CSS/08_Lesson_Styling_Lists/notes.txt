1. Lists and text

text-center might not work correctly there.
Consider using list-style-position to move text together with list "points".
```
ul {
 list-style-position: inside; 
}
 ```
	
line-height may be used for setting spacing between list items.

list-style-image can be used for images instead of symbols.


Shorthand for setting all properties:
```
list-style: square url('../images/checkmark.png') inside;
```
Square in this case is a default 'fallback' for marker if image not found. 

2. 
- 'li' selector is more specific than lists 'ul' / 'ol'.

- 'ul li' - selectors can be combined for more specificity.

- 'ul li:nth-child(2)' is for changing the specific child in list.

- 'ul li:nth-child(even|odd)' is for odd / even elements.


3. Markers 

- Markers can be selected by selector '::marker':
```
::marker {
	color: black;
}
```

- Also we can add ul / ol* before this selector to select ordered / unordered markers only.
		* and li too but this does not help as markers are only in li elements. 


- Text content for markers can be set in content setting together with text style:

```
ul ::marker {
  color: green;
  font-family: fantasy;
  font-size: 1em;
  content: "Only 5$ >> "
}
```

4. Html element list can have attribute "value".
<li value="26">bla bla</li>
When it comes to ordered list, the next value is calculated according to list setting from this explicitly set value.

Example, this list:
 <ol start="13" reversed>
	<li>Step One</li>
	<li value="26">Step Two</li>
	<li>Step Three</li>
</ol>

results in:
	m. Step One
	z. Step Two
	y. Step Three

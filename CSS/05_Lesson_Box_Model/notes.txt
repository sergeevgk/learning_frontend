Box Model:

Content -> padding -> border -> outline & margin


1. "CSS reset"
```
* {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	box-sizing: content-box;
}
```
This very basic wildcard selector will set some default values for all HTML elements.
(It resets the browser defaults).

content-box instructs browser to use sizes for the content itself, not including the padding and margin.
border-box instructs to count padding and border size together with content size.


2. Elements which are not part of box: 
	- Margin is outside the box, so it is not included in box model equation (size calculations). 
	  Style settings same as padding. 
	- Outline is outside the box (in most cases), so it is not included in box model equation. 
	  Style settings same as border.
	  It can be "inside" the border if outline-offset is negative. It does not take box space in any case.
	

3. Margin can be used with "auto" setting for left & right margin (not top and bottom).
With this setting it makes the margin equal and put the element in the middle (center horizontally).

1. Display block

Normally anchor tag is inline element but here it is changed to block-element.
Block elements have 100% width (of parent).
For acnhor tags this means that the whole block is an anchor (clickable) with all style setting applied.

below is an example for a list of anchors
```
li a {
	display: block;
}
```

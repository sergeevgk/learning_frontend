1. There are "pseudo-classes" which can be selected in CSS:

this is main selector for anchors
```
a {

}
```

and this is pseudo-class selector for "visited" anchors
```
a:visited {

 }
```

selectors for pseudo-classes can be combined just like the normal ones

```
a:hover, a:focus {
	color: hsl(189, 44%, 49%, 0.8);
	background: gold;	
}
```

Pseudo-class selectors have higher specificity than normal selectors. 
Among the pseudo-class selectors it is very important to write them in right "cascade" order.
For anchors it is: visited -> hover, focused -> active - to show all style chages as expected by user. 

2. It is good to not change the color of hovered link drastically.
The good choice is to slightly change opacity or choose a bit different color (hue) in HSL.
